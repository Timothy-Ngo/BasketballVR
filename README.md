## How to Play
Download APK and load onto headset.
### In Game
Select either Free Play or Timed Play. In Free Play, you can walk around and throw the basketball. Timed Play is the same except, the main goal is to score as many points within 60 seconds. 

#### Controls
- Right Trigger: Teleport ball 
- Right Grip: Catch or Throw ball
- Left Menu Button: Pause Menu
- Left Joystick: Movement

## Bugs
- When teleporting the ball to you, the ball may teleport back to where it was. To avoid this, hold down the trigger button (the button used to teleport the ball to you).
- Sometimes, you may spawn under the court. To fix this, open the pause menu (use menu button on the controller) and press restart.
- For any other unaccounted bugs, opening the pause menu and pressing restart should fix it.
